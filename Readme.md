# 🎯 Kalman and Particle Filter Simulation for Ball Trajectory Estimation

**Author:** Pranav Kumar Sah  

This project simulates ball trajectory estimation using two different filtering techniques: **Kalman Filter** and **Particle Filter**.  

- The **Kalman Filter** is applied to estimate the trajectory of a **single thrown ball**.  
- The **Particle Filter** is applied to estimate the trajectories of **two thrown balls simultaneously**.

## 📂 Project Structure

The folder contains the following files:

- 📓 **2 Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)**
  - `kalman_filter_simulation.ipynb` — End-to-end implementation of the Kalman Filter for a single ball.
  - `particle_filter_simulation.ipynb` — End-to-end implementation of the Particle Filter for two balls.

- 📄 **2 HTML Files (`.html`)**
  - `kalman_filter_output.html` — Rendered output of the Kalman Filter simulation.
  - `particle_filter_output.html` — Rendered output of the Particle Filter simulation.

## ⚙️ How to Use

- Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to view, run, and modify the code.
- Experiment by changing various parameters (e.g., initial state, noise levels, number of particles) to observe how it affects the estimation accuracy and convergence of both filters.
- Alternatively, open the `.html` files to view the simulation outputs without running the code.
